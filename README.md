# meet-helper

A Google Chrome extension to help users automate several things while having meetings on Google Meet.

I want this extension to:

- [ ] automatically take a screenshot when:
  - [x] shortly after joining a Meet call
  - [x] 5 minutes after joining a Meet call
  - [ ] when any participants starts sharing their screen
