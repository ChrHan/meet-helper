# meet-helper

This will be a Google Chrome extension to help users automate several things while having meetings on Google Meet.

I want this extension to:

- [ ] remind users to take a screenshot when:
  - [ ] joining a Meet call
  - [ ] 5 minutes after joining a Meet call
  - [ ] when any participants starts sharing their screen
